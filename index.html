This document also contains the weekly reports.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="system-overview">System Overview</h2>
<p>getdrinkrecpies.com is a recipe website for people who like to cook and try new recipes but don't know which ingredients they need to use to make the drink of dish they want. Users can post, search, rate and review/comment on recipes as well as attach pictures to a recipe. </p>
<p>People can input ingredients that they have in their kitchen/pantry and the website will  give them a list of recipes they can make with those ingredients. If the user picks a recipe to try and they don't have the ingredients a list of ingredients to buy will be generated for them. People can search for recipes by tag or by ingredients. If they want a more in-depth search they can filter searches. The user also has the ability to exclude ingredients from their searches.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<hr />
<p>The scope of the project was a great size in the beginning. However, towards the end more and more ideas were thrown in that shouldn't have been added. Had all these ideas been considered in the beginning, the scope would have been ok.</p>
<p>We learned that the project would have been better suited for a much smaller team. Two to three people would have been a better team size. Our team was disorganized. We couldn't meet up as often as we should have and a lot of the time there just wasn't enough work for the entire team to be deeply involved. The project size was good however, because if the project where to grow to accommodate the team size our skill set wouldn't have been able to handle it. </p>
<p>On a positive note, every member of the team learned a new technology, or improved a skill.</p></div>
